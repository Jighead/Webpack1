<p>This is a boilerplate/starter application you can use to get your project(s) started.
 It is not intended to be used with React, VUE,Angular or any otherJavaScript frameworks. Those frameworks have their own  CLI's for that.
 This starter will however allow you to build small to medium sized modular applications using ES6, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and Sass.
 It should be enough to get you started building SPA's as well as add addtional pages if needed. 
</p>
<p>I've created a couple of small simple samples to show what's possible. Build your directory/file structure however you prefer.
   Put your all your HTML in html files or create render functions to inject HTML into the DOM or both.
